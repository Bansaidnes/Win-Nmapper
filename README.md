# Win-Nmapper
A C# console application that enters all nmap commands into the terminal for you. Useful for when you're too lazy to enter the command every time for each Vlan ID. 

(Vlans are based on The Winchester School Jebel ali's network)                                                                                                            
(Only works on linux)
